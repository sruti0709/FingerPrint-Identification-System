# FingerPrint-Identification-System 
This is an application that uniquely identifies an user with biometrics
The automatic fingerprint identification systems have two important steps, such as fingerprint (a) image enhancement and (b) minutiae matching
The Matching Score is determined using a modified Tree Matching algorithm with assigned probability value with its level priority
The proposed modified Tree Matching algorithm has better matching percentage for different fingerprints as well as low quality fingerprint image compared to the existing algorithms
